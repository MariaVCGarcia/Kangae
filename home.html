            <h2> About the project</h2>
            <p>In this world, much like our own, there are magical creatures called katachi.
                Most don't know where they came from, some say they are gods, others think they are Spirits. 
                What they are doesn't really matter, not to humans anyway.
                What does matter is what they do, they give you purpose. 
                Here in this world that is everything, your worth, your value, all of it tied to your purpose.
                Some are born with the purpose to protect, others to create, others to nurture, others destroy…this directly leads to what you can do for society…be it good or bad a katachi will help you find what that thing is. 
                Most are assigned a katachi at the age of 11, most discover their purpose at the age of 18…
                it's rare for someone to choose a profession outside of their purpose but when it dose happen a katachi will help them find the right fit for said pourpus, for example if you are a protector, but don't like violence you would not become a police officer you would be a firefighter.
